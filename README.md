# ServiceTitan

This is the complete solution to the code challenge I was asked to complete during my interview with Service Titan.
In my interview I did not finish 2 of the 4 extension methods I was required to write, and the relative tests failed. 

This project attempts to reproduce the whole test (I had to, since the extension methods where dependent on the first piece)
so it includes an implementation for the first part of the test and for the follow up part.
